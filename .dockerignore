# Note: We actually WANT to keep the data/ folder if we want the app to have data on startup
# BUT, it's better to generate it or download it.
# For now, we'll keep the small data files but ignore the big ones if they were there.
# Let's NOT ignore the data folder entirely so Railway has the products.
